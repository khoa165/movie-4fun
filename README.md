# Movies 4Fun
#### Built with movies data from TMDB API, React with Hooks and Context API, Reactstrap (Bootstrap), Sass
For the app to work, you need to register an account on TMDB API and get an API key and place it in the file .env.local as REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=<<API_KEY_GOES_HERE>>.

-----------------------------------------------------
Available features:
- [x] Users can search for movies by name.
- [x] Users can see most relevant search results.
- [x] Users can click the button to navigate to movie page to see more detailed info.
- [x] Users can see the backdrop and poster (tablet+ size) of movie on movie page.
- [x] Users can see overview, rating, popular score, genres, production companies,... of the movie.

-----------------------------------------------------
Bugs to be fixed:
- [ ] TMDB API key does not work on Netlify even though I already added environment variables there.
